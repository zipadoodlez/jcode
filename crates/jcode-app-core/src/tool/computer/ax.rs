//! Tier 1: Accessibility (AX) read + action.
//!
//! This is the *background* control path. It drives other apps' UI elements by
//! reference through `System Events`, so it can press buttons and set field
//! values without moving the cursor and (for many actions) without bringing the
//! target app to the front.
//!
//! Elements are addressed by a structural path: an app (by name) plus a chain of
//! 1-based child indices from the front window. `find_element` / `ui` return
//! these paths; the action verbs accept them.
